![RoboPass Logo](https://robopass.netlify.app/static/media/logo.620ebac3a06605992961.png)

RoboPass is my first React app, a password generator that helps you create strong and secure passwords for your online accounts. As internet security is becoming increasingly important, having strong and unique passwords for each account is crucial. RoboPass is here to save the day! Its robust password-generating skills create tough passwords that are tough as titanium, making it extremely difficult for hackers to compromise your accounts.

I decided to create this app to demonstrate my skills in React.js and showcase my passion for web development. Through RoboPass, I aim to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to enhance their online security.

This project was inspired by "DynoPass," another password generator app with similar features. I was inspired by their concept and functionality, and I decided to create my own version called "RoboPass."

## Features

- Generate simple passwords with a mix of capitalized words, random numbers, and special characters.
- Generate strong passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Customize the length of generated passwords.
- User-friendly interface and easy-to-use controls.
